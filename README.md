JS-API : JapanSensei API<br />

Description
-

The point of this API is to provide webmasters an access to services linked to the japanese language. The functions are yet to be determined, and will be explained here thoroughly.
The source code is available for ease of access and debugging. It is useless without its content, so I don't advise you to try to run it.


Future development
-

To allow external websites to use the API, we have two choices. The preferred one is Django (https://www.djangoproject.com/) while the latter one is Apache with mod_wsgi (http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/).

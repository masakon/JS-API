JS-API : JapanSensei API\n
Written by Thierry Bertho <masa@japansensei.com>, 2012\n


Description
-----------

The point of this API is to provide webmasters an access to services linked to the japanese language. The functions are yet to be determined, and will be explained here thoroughly.\n
The source code is available for ease of access and debugging. It is useless without its content, so I don't advise you to try to run it\n


Future development
------------------

- Adapt the API to an apache environment (see mod_wsgi http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/)
